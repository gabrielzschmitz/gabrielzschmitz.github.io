Hello and welcome to my first blog post!

As I begin this blogging adventure, I thought it would be fitting to share a
little about my journey into software development. I’ve always been intrigued by
how things work—whether it’s computers, devices, or systems. But it wasn’t until
my teenage years that I truly discovered my passion for coding.

## The Beginning

Like many developers, my journey started with Minecraft mods in `Java` (Yuck!).
What began as a hobby quickly grew into a deeper passion for programming. Over
time, I ventured into low-level programming with `C` and began tinkering with
simple `NCurses` applications. These early experiences sparked my curiosity and
set me on a path of exploring more complex and challenging areas of software
development.

## Building Projects

One of the key things that has kept me motivated throughout my development
journey is working on real-world projects. Over the years, I've contributed to
open-source projects, created my own tools, and tackled coding challenges. It’s
been a rewarding experience seeing my work come to life and be used by others.

In particular, I’ve spent a lot of time focusing on algorithms, data structures,
and systems design. These areas have taught me how to think critically and
optimize solutions for complex problems. I’ve also recently been diving into the
world of `Golang` to tackle a variety of software challenges, including my most
recent research in post quantum cryptography at blockchain.

## Looking Ahead

As I continue this journey, I’m excited to share what I’m learning here on my
blog. I’ll be posting about projects I’m working on and maybe somethings about
my research or related topics. My hope is that you’ll find some useful insights
here and maybe even learn something new.

Thanks for reading, and I look forward to sharing more with you!
